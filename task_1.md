# Challenge Part 1: Web Development with React

For the first part of the challenge you will create a React App based on [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). The application should be based on the [user stories](https://github.com/uzh-bf/dev-challenge/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) defined below. It must implement **all required user stories** as well as **one user story from the additional section**.

## Required User Stories

- [User Story 0: App Setup](https://github.com/uzh-bf/dev-challenge/issues/8)
- [User Story 1: Kanban Board](https://github.com/uzh-bf/dev-challenge/issues/1)
- [User Story 2: Task Cards](https://github.com/uzh-bf/dev-challenge/issues/2)
- [User Story 3: Styling](https://github.com/uzh-bf/dev-challenge/issues/9)
- [User Story 4: Homepage](https://github.com/uzh-bf/dev-challenge/issues/4)

## Additional User Stories

- [User Story 5: Deployment to Heroku with GitHub Actions](https://github.com/uzh-bf/dev-challenge/issues/5)
- [User Story 6: Adding Tasks](https://github.com/uzh-bf/dev-challenge/issues/3)
- [User Story 7: Tracking with Google Analytics](https://github.com/uzh-bf/dev-challenge/issues/7)

## Requirements, Constraints, and Ideas

Your application must satisfy the following basic constraints:

- :exclamation: It must be based on `React` and initialized with `create-react-app`.
- :exclamation: It must apply the `lourenci/react-kanban` library for logic related to Kanban interactions. We recommend using the `uncontrolled` version of the board to save you a lot of boilerplate (and time).
  - Because we are using a new feature, use the command `npm install git://github.com/uzh-bf/react-kanban.git#render-custom-card-adder` to install the package directly from git 
  - if this command doesn't work, make sure you have git cli installed on your machine (MacOS: XCode Command Line Tools)
- :exclamation: It must satisfy the acceptance criteria of all high-priority [user stories](https://github.com/uzh-bf/dev-challenge/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc), plus one additional user story of your choosing. Any further work is optional.
- :bulb: Besides these basic requirements, you may use any libraries or tools you like.
